            <p>
                Hello welcome! <br> My name is Agnelo Schmitt Neto, Brazilian, born on May 20, 1982
                 in Santo Angelo/RS. Currently residing in Caxias do Sul/RS <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional background/experience was in the Metalworking Industry, working mainly with
                 Machine Programming and also in the Technical/Industrial Production/Mechatronics area by SENAI.
                 I have 14 years of experience as a (Robotist/Industrial Robots in the Welding process) and as a CNC programmer, Machining and Laser Cutting.
                 I also acted as Sector Leader/Facilitator (People Management).
            <p>
                I am a Dedicated, Mature and Responsible professional.
                 I am looking for a career transition to the technology area in software development and
                 Systems Analysis
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now I've been studying new technologies like JavaScript, NodeJS, Typescript and C#,
                 I really like the Technical Part, I have Ease and curiosity to learn new activities,
                 I deal well with Changes and I like to share knowledge, I believe that learning and
                 personal/professional development is directly linked to the exchange of experiences.
